## VibeManager - Introduction

Welcome to VibeManager! This is our project designed to simplify the management of cultural events and artistic spaces. With VibeManager, organizers can create and manage events, handle logistical details, and promote activities, while users can discover events, make reservations, and engage in unique cultural experiences.

Our team consists of Facundo and Juan. Together, we've built an intuitive platform that offers features like event calendars, reservation management, personalized notifications, and location-based search, all with multilingual support to reach a global audience.

We are excited to share VibeManager with you and hope it helps enrich the cultural scene and connect people through art and creativity.

Thank you for visiting our project!
